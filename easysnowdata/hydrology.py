# Now exectute the call to the USGS Watershed Boundary Dataset REST API. There are several possibilities here if the following step does not execute properly. There is a print statement implemented that should provide some indication of which it is.

# If you receive the error Error with Service Call or Error loading JSON output, this most likely indicates that the region you selected does coincide with a USGS hydrologic unit from that particular service.

# If you recieve the error {'message': 'Endpoint request timed out'}, this likely indicates the Watershed Boundary Dataset service may be down. To check, click this link (https://stats.uptimerobot.com/gxzRZFARLZ/783928857). If you are greeted with the message ScienceBase is down., the service is temporarily down and it is not possible to query the service at this time.

# If the cell executes successfully, the interesecting watershed boundary geometry will be printed.
